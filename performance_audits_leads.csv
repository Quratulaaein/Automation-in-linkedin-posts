Performance Audits,RFP for operations performance audit services,Past 24 hours,"😅💼 When “True and Fair” Takes a Coffee Break — Auditing Under Special Purpose Frameworks! Ever had a client say — “Our accounts are prepared on a special basis...” …and suddenly your audit plan feels not-so-standard anymore? 🚧 Welcome to the fascinating world of Special Purpose Frameworks (SPF) —where “true and fair” meets “fit for purpose.” 😄 🧭 What Exactly Is a Special Purpose Framework? A Special Purpose Framework (SPF) is used when financial statements are designed to serve specific users or objectives, not everyone. Think of it as the tailor-made suit of financial reporting 👔 — made to measure, not off-the-rack. Common examples include: -Cash basis accounts (common in NGOs) -Regulatory frameworks (SEBI, IRDAI, RBI, etc.) -Contractual reporting (for lenders, donors, or investors) ⚙️ Auditing Under SPF = SA 800 in Action! Yes, these audits are governed by SA 800 – “Special Considerations—Audits of Financial Statements Prepared in Accordance with Special Purpose Frameworks.” Here’s what sets them apart 👇 ✅ Auditor’s opinion must refer explicitly to the framework (e.g., “as described in Note X…”) ✅ Report should state the intended users and purpose clearly ✅ May include a restriction on use or distribution ✅ The framework’s acceptability and disclosure are key 🤔 Here’s the Real Catch! Many finance professionals are still unaware of how the use of SPF audits differ from general-purpose audits — yet these are becoming increasingly common in practice.From lender-specific certifications to donor-driven reports, SPFs are quietly becoming a part of everyday assurance work. And yes — they come with unique reporting formats, audit considerations, and documentation requirements. 💡 Pro Tip for Finance Professionals Before signing off: ✔️ Document why the SPF is appropriate ✔️ Identify who the intended users are ✔️ Ensure the audit fully aligns with SA 800 Because someday, someone will ask — “What’s so special about this purpose?” 😅 🎯 Final Thought Auditing under a special purpose framework reminds us that assurance isn’t always “one-size-fits-all.” Sometimes, as finance professionals, our role is to go beyond numbers —to interpret intent, ensure clarity, and deliver assurance with purpose. 💪 Because at the end of the day — we don’t just sign reports, we build trust. 🤝 hashtag # Audit hashtag # FinanceProfessionals hashtag # Assurance hashtag # SpecialPurposeFramework hashtag # FinancialReporting hashtag # AccountingCommunity hashtag # AuditorLife hashtag # ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag # AuditInsights",,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/7391893984630964224,https://www.linkedin.comhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ca-krishna-toshniwal-7781a21b5,2025-11-06 19:00:58

When civility turns into complacency, boards risk missing opportunities to refresh skills, diversify perspectives, and align with evolving stakeholder expectations.

Performance Audits,business looking for IT systems performance audit,Filter by Past 24 hours,"A Note to Aspiring IS Audit Professionals. I have noticed a recurring pattern when posting roles such as IS Control or IS Audit. Despite clearly stating that these positions are not traditional operational or financial audit or control roles, and that relevant Information System experience is required, many applicants from purely financial audit backgrounds still apply. Let’s be honest: if an organization hires you as an experienced professional, they expect you to hit the ground running. Coming into a highly specialized role without the right background can leave you struggling to perform effectively. It is great to be ambitious, but motivation alone is not enough (aspire to perspire) especially in technical domains like information systems audit. If you are looking to transition from operational or financial audit to IS audit, a smart approach is to begin that journey within your current organization. That way, you can gain hands-on exposure, learn gradually, and make the switch with far less pressure than starting over in a new environment.
