CRM Services,RFP for CRM software vendor,Filter by Past 24 hours,"⏰ Most software RFPs fail - not because of poor process, but because of poor timing. I see this all the time: a team runs an RFP three-six months before a renewal for a deeply embedded software (for example an ERP or CRM). Sure, the vendor might shave a bit off the price to “play the game”, but let’s be honest: they know you can’t switch in time. And they’ll hang that over you. Because when your system is deeply embedded, processes, data, integrations, user training, three months isn’t negotiation leverage, it’s a deadline trap. Now imagine this: the recommended migration timeline for a CRM is 9–12 months (yes, it really is - Virtuous outlines this perfectly here https://lnkd.in/e-GYTAAJ ). You start an RFP then. Suddenly, the balance shifts. That’s not a “let’s see if we can get 5% off” move. That’s “we have the time, plan, and runway to actually change vendors.” Because this isn’t just a bluff anymore.

CRM Services,need to outsource CRM customization project,Past 24 hours,"Hiring dedicated developers vs. project-based outsourcing - what's better for your startup? “Should I hire a dedicated team or just outsource my project?” - a founder once asked me. I have seen both. Project-based works great for short-term goals - build fast, deliver, move on. But for long-term products, it falls short. You lose context, continuity, and ownership. When you hire a dedicated team, they grow with your product. They remember decisions, avoid repeated mistakes, and build like owners. One of our startup clients switched from project outsourcing to a dedicated model - Within 2 months, bugs dropped, delivery time improved, and founder stress went down.

CRM Services,need to outsource CRM customization project,Past month,"3 mistakes SaaS founders make when outsourcing development Outsourcing is supposed to save time but for many founders, it turns into a headache. After working with several SaaS startups, we’ve noticed the same 3 patterns repeat: 1️⃣ No clear ownership. Founders hire a team but skip defining who owns what. The result? Confusion, missed deadlines, and finger-pointing. 2️⃣ Fuzzy documentation. Even the best developers can’t fix unclear requirements. A one-line Jira ticket like “improve dashboard speed” isn’t enough. 3️⃣ No overlap in communication. If you’re in the US and your dev team is in India, communication windows matter. A daily 20-min sync can prevent weeks of rework. The fix? 👉 Define ownership. 👉 Write problem-focused requirements. 👉 Communicate predictably. When done right, outsourcing isn’t a compromise, it’s leverage. We help SaaS startups set up dev processes that actually work across time zones.

If you require backend access before bidding please request it and I can provide the access. I will only meet with the successful bidder(s) if needed or desired, not during the bidding process. First Item: The current system has a single payment function which is connected to Stripe currently. We need to change the single payment function to monthly subscription payments. This may also need to involve changes to our Stripe set up (which we can handle if needed). This will also need to include the ability to cancel the subscription, upgrade the subscription, downgrade the subscription in the logged in area for the user. The admin area will also need to have the ability to fully manage subscriptions. Second item: The current system only allows users to add leads or customers one at a time. We need to add a csv upload option for leads and customers. There needs to be a button when a user is logged in that also allows for multiple records (lead or customer) to be added at once by uploading a CSV. There will also need to be a sample CSV the User can download so they can see the proper format to upload a CSV in. Third item: The current system only allows for manual entry of contacts into the system. We need to allow for Integration with Google email contacts or Microsoft email contacts. There may be an API that allows for this. When a contact is added to the users email platform there needs to be an automatic upload of that contact to the CRM. There would also need to be a mechanism in the CRM to connect the email platform to the CRM and allow the contacts to transfer automatically.
