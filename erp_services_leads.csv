ERP Services,RFP for ERP software vendor,Filter by Past 24 hours,"⏰ Most software RFPs fail - not because of poor process, but because of poor timing. I see this all the time: a team runs an RFP three-six months before a renewal for a deeply embedded software (for example an ERP or CRM). Sure, the vendor might shave a bit off the price to “play the game”, but let’s be honest: they know you can’t switch in time. And they’ll hang that over you. Because when your system is deeply embedded, processes, data, integrations, user training, three months isn’t negotiation leverage, it’s a deadline trap. Now imagine this: the recommended migration timeline for a CRM is 9–12 months (yes, it really is - Virtuous outlines this perfectly here https://lnkd.in/e-GYTAAJ ). You start an RFP then. Suddenly, the balance shifts. That’s not a “let’s see if we can get 5% off” move. That’s “we have the time, plan, and runway to actually change vendors.” Because this isn’t just a bluff anymore.
