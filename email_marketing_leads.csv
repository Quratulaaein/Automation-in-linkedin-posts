Most had no idea. Here’s the truth — email marketing is more technical than most people think. It’s not just about designing nice templates or hitting “send.” It’s about understanding deliverability, data, and how your system truly works behind the scenes.

Email Marketing,require email automation setup for business,Past 24 hours,"The other day, a new business requirement popped up in my inbox: “We need to send an automated email when a loan gets approved.” Pretty straightforward, right? Well… not really. 👀 As a Business Analyst, I’ve learned that *no requirement is ever as simple as it sounds.* So instead of noting it down, I started asking questions: * What’s the real purpose behind this email? * Who should receive it, and when exactly? * Which system will trigger it — Salesforce, workflow, or API? * What’s the key metric to define success? Each question opened a new layer of understanding — and by the end, it wasn’t just about an email anymore. It became a well-structured business process that actually added value. That’s the beauty of being a BA — we don’t just *gather* requirements, we *decode* them.
